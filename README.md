This is Brian's Application for the WeHelp bootcap program in TW.
I'm still learning the basics of website programming (2024 style:)).
I do have some experience in programming and scripting for work-related stuff...
But developing something entirely new is a brand new thing for me.

It's still a work in progress, but I've made up my mind. I want to finish this by the 23th of February and submit the aplication.
Please wish me luck!
